### The Workflow
 
The general workflow of Autodesk 3ds Max Design 2015 involves four main steps: modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering. You can also add animation and effects to your scene if you want. Here is a brief description of each step:

- Modeling: This is the process of creating the shapes and forms of your objects using various tools and modifiers. You can use primitives, splines, polygons, NURBS, or other methods to create your models. You can also import models from other software or sources.
- Texturing: This is the process of applying materials and maps to your objects to give them color, texture, reflection, transparency, etc. You can use the material editor to create and edit materials and maps. You can also use UVW mapping to control how the maps are applied to your objects.
- Lighting: This is the process of adding lights to your scene to create realistic or artistic effects. You can use different types of lights, such as standard lights, photometric lights, daylight systems, etc. You can also adjust the properties and parameters of each light to control its intensity, color, shadow, etc.
- Rendering: This is the process of generating an image or a sequence of images from your scene using a renderer. You can use the render setup dialog to choose a renderer and set various options for output quality, resolution, format, etc. You can also use render elements to separate different aspects of your image for post-processing.
