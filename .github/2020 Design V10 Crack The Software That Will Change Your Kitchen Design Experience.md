## Example 1: A Modern Kitchen Design
 
For this example, we will create a modern kitchen design with white cabinets, black countertops, stainless steel appliances and a large island. We will use the 2020 Design Live web application to access the online catalogs and configurators.
 
First, we will start by creating a new project and choosing the room shape and dimensions. We will also add windows and doors to the room. Then, we will select the cabinets from the 2020 Cloud Configurator. We can choose from different styles, colors, finishes and sizes. We can also customize the cabinets by adding drawers, shelves, handles and accessories.
 
Next, we will add the countertops from the 2020 Cloud Configurator. We can choose from different materials, colors and edges. We can also adjust the thickness and overhang of the countertops. Then, we will add the appliances from the online catalogs. We can choose from different brands, models and features. We can also drag and drop them to the desired position.
 
Finally, we will add some decorative items from the 2020 Cloud Decorative Items and SketchUp integration. We can choose from different categories, such as lighting, furniture, plants, rugs and art. We can also resize, rotate and move them to create a realistic scene.
 
Now that we have completed our design, we can use the EZ Render engine to create a photorealistic image of our kitchen. We can choose from different rendering modes, such as standard, high quality or panorama. We can also adjust the lighting settings, such as brightness, contrast and color temperature. We can also add effects, such as depth of field, bloom and vignette.
 
Here is the final result of our modern kitchen design:

## Example 2: A Cozy Bathroom Design
 
For this example, we will create a cozy bathroom design with wood cabinets, marble countertops, white tiles and a freestanding tub. We will use the 2020 Design V10 desktop software to access the local catalogs and custom items.
 
First, we will start by creating a new project and choosing the room shape and dimensions. We will also add windows and doors to the room. Then, we will select the cabinets from the local catalog. We can choose from different styles, colors, finishes and sizes. We can also customize the cabinets by adding drawers, shelves, handles and accessories.
 
Next, we will add the countertops from the local catalog. We can choose from different materials, colors and edges. We can also adjust the thickness and overhang of the countertops. Then, we will add the tiles from the local catalog. We can choose from different patterns, colors and sizes. We can also apply them to different surfaces, such as walls, floors and backsplashes.
 
Finally, we will add some custom items that we have created or imported from other sources. We can create custom items by using the shape tool or importing from AutoCAD or SketchUp. We can also edit their properties, such as color, texture and material. For this example, we have created a freestanding tub, a shower head and a faucet.
 
Now that we have completed our design, we can use the lighting wizard to add realistic lighting effects to our bathroom. We can choose from different types of lights, such as ambient, task or accent. We can also adjust their position, direction and intensity. We can also change their color temperature and hue.
