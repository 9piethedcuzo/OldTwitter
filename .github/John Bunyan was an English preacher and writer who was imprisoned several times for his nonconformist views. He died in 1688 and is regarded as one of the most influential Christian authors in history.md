# La Guerra Santa: The Holy War by John Bunyan
 
La Guerra Santa (The Holy War) is an allegorical novel by John Bunyan, the author of The Pilgrim's Progress. It tells the story of the battle between the forces of good and evil for the soul of a city called Mansoul. The novel was first published in 1682 and has been translated into many languages, including Spanish and Portuguese.
 
The novel begins with a description of the creation and fall of Mansoul, which was originally a perfect and beautiful city, but was corrupted by the deceitful Diabolus, who persuaded its inhabitants to rebel against their rightful king, Shaddai. Diabolus and his army of evil spirits then took over the city and enslaved its people. Shaddai, however, did not abandon Mansoul, but sent his son Emmanuel and his captains to rescue it. The novel narrates the various battles and sieges that took place between the two sides, as well as the internal struggles of the citizens of Mansoul, who were divided between loyalty to Shaddai and allegiance to Diabolus.

The novel is full of symbolism and allegory, as Bunyan uses different characters and events to represent aspects of the Christian life and doctrine. For example, Diabolus represents Satan, Shaddai represents God, Emmanuel represents Jesus Christ, Mansoul represents the human soul, and the various captains and soldiers represent virtues and vices. The novel also contains many references to the Bible and to Bunyan's own personal experiences as a Puritan preacher and prisoner.

La Guerra Santa is considered one of Bunyan's most important works, as it shows his deep understanding of human nature and his skill as a storyteller. It is also a powerful illustration of the spiritual warfare that every Christian faces in his or her journey to heaven.

The novel also portrays the different types of people who live in Mansoul, such as the simple, the ignorant, the doubting, the wise, the faithful, and the wicked. Some of them are easily deceived by Diabolus and his agents, while others resist and suffer for their loyalty to Shaddai. Some of them repent and receive forgiveness, while others persist in their rebellion and face judgment. Some of them are also transformed by the grace of Emmanuel, such as Mr. Prejudice, who becomes Mr. Love-God, and Mr. Ill-Pause, who becomes Mr. Good-Work.
 
The novel ends with the final assault of Diabolus and his allies on Mansoul, which is repelled by Emmanuel and his army. Diabolus and his followers are captured and thrown into a burning pit, while Mansoul is purified and restored to its original glory. Emmanuel then departs from Mansoul, but promises to return for the final consummation of his kingdom. He leaves behind some of his captains and soldiers to guard and instruct Mansoul until his second coming.

The novel is not only a vivid depiction of the spiritual warfare that every Christian faces, but also a reflection of Bunyan's own life and times. Bunyan was a Nonconformist preacher who suffered persecution and imprisonment for his faith under the reign of Charles II. He wrote The Holy War during his second imprisonment in Bedford jail, where he also wrote The Pilgrim's Progress. Some of the characters and events in the novel are based on his personal experiences and observations, such as the trial of Mr. Faithful, who represents John Child, a Baptist martyr who was executed in 1684.
 
The novel also contains many memorable quotes that express Bunyan's insights and convictions about the Christian life. For example, he writes: \"Nothing can hurt you except sin; nothing can grieve me except sin; nothing can defeat you except sin. Therefore, be on your guard, my Mansoul.\" (p. 191) He also writes: \"In prayer it is better to have a heart without words than words without a heart.\" (p. 96) And he writes: \"No man, without trials and temptations, can attain a true understanding of the Holy Scriptures.\" (p. 89)
