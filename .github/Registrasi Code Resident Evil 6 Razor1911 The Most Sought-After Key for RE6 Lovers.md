If you want to play Resident Evil 6 on your PC, you might need a registration code to activate the game. This code is usually provided by the publisher or the retailer when you buy the game. However, some people might have downloaded the game from unofficial sources and need a registration code to bypass the security check.
 
One of the sources that claim to provide a registration code for Resident Evil 6 is Razor1911, a group of hackers and crackers who have been releasing cracked versions of games since the 1980s. Razor1911 has uploaded a file called Resident Evil 6-Razor1911 on various torrent sites and file-sharing platforms. The file contains the game files and a registration code generator.
 
However, before you download and use this file, you should be aware of the risks and consequences of using a cracked version of Resident Evil 6. Here are some of them:
 
- You might be violating the intellectual property rights of Capcom and other parties involved in the development and distribution of the game.
- You might be exposing your PC to malware, viruses, spyware, and other harmful programs that might be hidden in the file or downloaded along with it.
- You might be unable to access the official updates, patches, DLCs, and online features of the game.
- You might be banned from online platforms and services that detect pirated games.
- You might be facing legal actions from Capcom or other authorities if they trace your IP address or other information.

Therefore, we do not recommend using Razor1911's registration code for Resident Evil 6. Instead, we suggest that you buy the game from a legitimate source and support the developers who worked hard to create this game. You can find Resident Evil 6 on Steam, Origin, Amazon, or other online stores for a reasonable price. You can also look for discounts and deals on various websites and forums.
 
By buying the game legally, you will not only enjoy the full features and benefits of Resident Evil 6, but also avoid any potential problems and issues that might arise from using a cracked version. You will also help Capcom to continue making more games in the Resident Evil series and other genres.
